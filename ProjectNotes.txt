Assignment #4: Image Conversion Functions

NOTE: I implemented the extra credit, with something extra. When an image is removed, its job record's imageSourceattribute is set to null, for 2 reasons:

    1. The URL in imageSource would no longer be functioning, so no sense keeping it available
    2. Allows timed function to quickly see which successful conversions have not yet been cleaned up.

(If this did not occur, the timed function would attempt to delete a large number of already deleted images. That could be quite costly if there are a lot of successful jobs.)
